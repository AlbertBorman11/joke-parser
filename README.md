# Joke Generator

This is a simple joke generator script that fetches random jokes from Russian and English joke websites using web scraping and API requests.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Requests library (`pip install requests`)
- BeautifulSoup library (`pip install beautifulsoup4`)


The script will fetch a random Russian joke from 'https://anekdot.ru/random/anekdot' and a random English joke from 'https://icanhazdadjoke.com'. The jokes will be displayed in the console.

## Customization

You can modify the code to add more joke sources or change the scraping logic according to your requirements.
